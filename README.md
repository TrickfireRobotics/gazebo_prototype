## Gazebo Simulation Prototype
### Master branch: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TrickfireRobotics/gazebo_prototype.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TrickfireRobotics/gazebo_prototype)
A robot simulation in Gazebo for use in prototyping various concepts. This takes the core of a simple skid-steer robot (designed to simulate tank treads as treads aren't supported in Gazebo) and then allows all of our team members to add on to the chassis with their own prototype additions such as Kinects, IMUs, lidars, or anything else we feel needs to be tested.
